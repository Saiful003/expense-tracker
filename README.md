## Project-Name:  `Expense-Tracker`

### A Brief about the project (Ideas, Planning, etc) -

Well, the idea came into my mind 2 years ago and honestly, I just wanted to make a simple transaction tracker. back at that time
im not that good at the backend, just had some basic knowledge about the server side. That's why I've decided I will build the 
frontend part only, also I needed a design to build my frontend structure but couldn't manage that also. in between, I tried to
make some demos of my frontend structure but didn't satisfy myself so eventually, I stopped moving forward with that project
(but I promised myself I would complete this project one day for sure). later on(2,000 years later), One day I shared my project 
idea with (Nahid Fedous Mohit) who is a very good friend + brother of mine. he gave me a lot of cool ideas about this project and a
nice guideline about this project again I started working on this project I came up with an idea why don't I build this project 
as a team rather than make it alone? so I invited 2 of my genius friends to work on this project (Antareep Hasan, and Shanto Islam), when I 
invited them I was really worried because they were gonna decline my invitation. because They are very (Elite level) person and it's 
really hard to get their schedule but im lucky they've accepted my offer and I will always be grateful for their time :). 
Jokes apart,  After a lot of discussions, Apporox (March 17, 2024) I started building the frontend part and my friends started working 
on the backend. and on(May-27,2024) We deployed our project initially, although there was still a lot of work to do we had finished 
the main part. which I still feel is unreal. somehow i fullfill my dream(Alhamdulliah). 

### Materials we used to build our frontend -

As I told earlier, we didn't have any visuals/ figma design for our projects, so it became hard to build a frontend structure without visuals, That is where Mohit gave me an idea to overcome this issue, he introduced me
to (Shadcn). Shadcn UI is a Beautifully designed component that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source. This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of 
reusable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. So when I saw there were a bunch of beautiful readymade components and when I realized most of the components I could use for my project, I instantly
started working with Shadcn. Currently, our project's visual that you can see is built in with Shadcn(100%).


### Core Features - 

1. The main moto of this app is, that you can save the details about your income/expenses ( Daily, monthly, yearly) in it.
2. You can see all the transactions from the transaction list.
3. You can edit or delete any individual transactions from the transaction list.
4. You can create an account for yourself, ( we have built it in this way, so individual users can make their account)
4. From the settings page, you can change your ( Picture, name, password ) if you want.
